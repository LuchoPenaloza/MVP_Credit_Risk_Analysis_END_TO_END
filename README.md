# PROJECT: MVP CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS / SYSTEM END-TO-END
## Overview
System end-to-end based in an API service that is backed by a machine or deep learning model (from a list of many models) that will accept a financial profile and will be able to predict a credit risk score for that profile. This minimum viable product (MVP) could be adapted depending on the industry, client, cases to use, new datasets, etc.; and could be deployed in an AWS, local or web environment because everything will be dockerized.

## Development
All the details will be explained on the documentation files that are sharing on this repo. Also, all the code was oriented from one original dataset with information to parse, refine, preprocess, and use to our ML and DL models, so the system is oriented to that original dataset, nevertheless can be adapted to other datasets depending on the needs and available information that the new business cases may have.

## Documentation
The system is ready to be implemented as an MVP. If you want to understand the inner system and implement it, go to the technical role guide and tech manuals; if you want to use it, go to the final client guide.

If you want to have an executive summary of the entire project, please go to these files on the documentation folder on this repo, in the following order:

1.- User guide – Final Client / UX

2.- Executive report
